"Ecopark opportunity for rural/leisure development, Haddington, East Lothian",MAY506243,ocds-r6ebe6-0000765453,East Lothian Council,30/05/2024,,,01 Prior Information Notices (below GPA/OJEU threshold or call offs of any value),Yes,No,"Ecopark opportunity for rural/leisure development, Haddington, East Lothian.CPV: 70321000, 70332100, 92330000.","East Lothian Council wishes to obtain notes of interest and proposals for the following off -grid, biodiversity self-sufficient development opportunity requiring a Net Zero footprint:
A part of Amisfield Park near Haddington, East Lothian, has been identified for an appropriate low environmental impact rural or leisure development. This area is a local biodiversity site.
The site is within designated countryside as well as within Haddington Conservation Area and is situated approx. 800m east of Haddington. It is within easy walking distance through the park to all of Haddington’s attractions including the golf club and public restaurant which is very close to the site.
Any new development proposals must be compatible with the ELLDP & additional policies as stipulated within the Planning Guidelines document attached. Any new proposal would have to be complementary to the historic landscape setting of Amisfield and the town of Haddington. It must provide a well-connected network of paths with road infrastructure limited to connecting to the existing networks. Wider connectivity should be through the provision of green networks and in the wider area ensuring access for all in the community favouring, where appropriate, active travel and public transport then cars as forms of movement.
One of the uses acceptable in principle is a caravan/glamping/camping site (it must not harm views to and from the A listed Walled Garden). Any static or mobile holiday accommodation and its surrounds must therefore consider how it will visually affect the visitor experience to the Walled Garden and its impact on the historic value within the wider setting.  It would also have to be relatively low height and minimal footprint in order to avoid an unacceptable detrimental visual impact on the locality and of a design that could easily blend into the existing landscape. There is potential for better biodiversity management of the remainder of the site.
Creating individual small spaces throughout the site to facilitate fixed and/or mobile accommodation, vehicular access and parking, as well as the necessary onsite facilities is essential, and using the existing land contouring and vegetation must be considered within the wider context to create an acceptable fit.
The historic B listed single storey crenelated folly located within the site should be integrated into the development whilst maintaining and reinstating its current form.  The views to and from the folly to the walled garden and beyond must be kept uninterrupted.
A sensitive and appropriate proposal could include the opportunity to improve the management of the site for the benefit of wildlife and people. Development must not adversely impact the wider ecological network of the site.  There is an area of the invasive species Snowberry on the eastern section of the site, could be an option for Biodiversity Net Gain mitigation work that could be explored further.
A detailed Habitat Management Plan should be prepared to support proposals that could have an impact on the local biodiversity site and incorporate nature conservation considerations contained within Annex A of the Planning Guideline document.
Prior to the commencement of any development, a successful applicant would be required to submit for approval in writing by the Planning Authority, a plan detailing the proposed Biodiversity Enhancement scheme for the site in line with National Planning Framework 4 Policy 3. This could achieved through at various stages of the application i.e. in the Preliminary Ecological Report or Habitat Enhancement Plan.
Rent for this land would be obtained through negotiation with the opportunity to offset the first few years against capital set up costs working towards a fair market rent.",,"70332100

The site is also part of West Mainland SSSI and Orkney Mainland Moors SPA which recognise Birsay Moors’ importance for breeding Hen Harrier, Red-Throated Diver and Short Eared Owl as well as bog plant communities.
The identified restoration site has been subject to extensive peat cutting historically. Whilst some of these peat banks are re-vegetating, there are significant areas of actively eroding peat faces and hags, as well as erosion gullies and areas of micro-erosion across the site. This is leading to further erosion of peat and drying out of the surrounding vegetation. Restoring these features will improve the resilience and overall health/condition of the habitat making it better able to support a range of wildlife and be able to cope with changing weather patterns linked to climate change.
The site boundary for the restoration area is approximately 146 ha in size, with the footprint of restoration work expected to be approximately 131 ha. It is expected that the Contractor will work to restore all erosion features in this area using a combination of machine work and hand labour. The work will be procured on a treatment basis which includes machine days, hand labour days and the supply of materials. The site has been assessed and requires a combination of work using a range of machinery of appropriate size on extra wide low ground pressure tracks for peat-based techniques and manual construction by hand of plastic pile, wooden and coir log dams.
A range of techniques will be employed to treat the features in this area, these are detailed below within the tender specification. It is anticipated that machine work will be the preference, although there are some small, sensitive areas that may require hand work for the instillation of dams. Required materials will be moved into the area with a suitable ATV.",Price is not the only award criterion and all criteria are stated only in the procurement documents,,"NUTS code:

It is a key part of each organisation's internal control systems because it measures and evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of other controls in order that:
a) the Management Committee and Management Team of the organisations can know the extent to which they may rely on the whole control system; and
b) individual managers can know the reliability or otherwise of the systems and controls for which they are responsible.
2.The responsibility for ensuring that appropriate and adequate arrangements are established for internal control rests with management of the organisations.  The internal auditor will be responsible for conducting an independent appraisal and giving assurance to the appropriate Sub-Committee on internal control arrangements.  It is for management to determine whether to accept and implement recommendations made by the internal auditor or, alternatively, for recognising and accepting the risks resulting from not taking an action.
3.The work of the internal audit service shall embrace the whole internal control systems of the organisations including all activities, funded from whatever source.  The internal audit service will consider the adequacy of systems and controls necessary to secure propriety, economy, efficiency and effectiveness in all areas. It will seek to confirm that management have taken the necessary steps to achieve these objectives.
4.The internal auditor will be expected to carry out a rolling programme of internal audit work so that all main aspects of our operations are assessed at least once during the initial three years.
5.Each organisation's current internal audit service consists of 10 days per annum which typically include the following:
- Between two and three assurance audits;
- Follow up on implementation of previous audit points;
- Audit Needs Assessment and preparation of annual plan, completed for the appropriate Sub-Committee to approve;
- Annual Report; and
- Audit Contract Management.
It is on the above basis that bidders should tender.","Criteria below:

ScotRail will be using the Competitive Procedure with Negotiation for this tender. This procurement route allows the buying organisation to clarify bids with tenderers after their initial bid. The stages are listed below:
1.	Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ, also called a Single Procurement Document / SPD): this is the ‘Selection Stage’. Any bidder may submit a PQQ. Bidders submit their PQQ and are evaluated against the selection criteria. It is envisaged that 2 - 5 of the highest scoring Suppliers will be taken through to the Initial Tender stage.
2.	Initial Tender (Invitation To Negotiate / ITN): the shortlisted suppliers are requested to submit their initial tender. These are evaluated against the Award Criteria stated in Section 6 of this document.
3.	Evaluation: after the evaluation of initial tenders (ITN), ScotRail may decide to award the framework or alternatively, we may negotiate on an equal treatment basis with the bidders.
4.	Negotiation: there may be multiple stages of negotiation and we may conduct these in successive stages, reducing the number of bidders per round. We will then inform the remaining bidders when we decide to conclude the negotiations and set a common deadline to submit any new or revised tenders. At the end of this process (which may include a best and final offers stage) we propose to award the contract to the supplier with the most economically advantageous tender using the award criteria in the ITT document.",Price is not the only award criterion and all criteria are stated only in the procurement documents,79340000,"NUTS code:

SPS recognises that the ability of those in custody to develop their digital skills is limited to that of a classroom setting and is seeking opportunities to develop this further.  In addition, one of the SPS’s Digital Strategy’s objectives is to enhance the digital skills of its staff group and move away from various transaction activities that take up a considerable amount of their time. SPS staff still rely extensively on paper-based systems for managing basic day-to-day activities. Research has identified that adoption of new technology requires active engagement and perceived positive outcomes from both of these user group(s) in order to accept new ways of working.It should be noted that the overall solution is split into two key aspects – the operating system and access device. The required device is still being established by the internal project group but SPS seeks options that are being utilised from the marketplace (this can be more than one).As a result of the above, the SPS is intending to issue a tender activity for a supplier to install and manage an in-cell system to all operational Establishments. The system will include a standalone managed portal with a range of modules (including menu selection, PPC balance, staff messaging and notice board). SPS does not seek a platform that is a ""design and development solution"" or an ""agile development solution"" as it should be well established. However, SPS would seek to expand modules as required via the supplier and have the ability to add 3rd party modules (such as education modules) as appropriate during the contract term.SPS expects to commence a period of market sounding in the coming weeks to provide and obtain information regarding potential solutions. All suppliers interested in participating in market sounding should note interest in this PIN notice.CPV: 72000000, 30211300, 30231100, 72590000, 72500000, 30230000.",The SPS is expecting to commence a period of market sounding.

The Institute for Gravitational Research requires a large scale accessible vacuum system to be used for prototyping next generation room temperature fused silica mirror suspension technology for 3rd generation gravitational-wave observatory infrastructure. These instruments will extend the range of gravitational astronomy by at least an order of magnitude. The UK will be a key future contributor to this research, co-developing the conceptual design of the next generation of interferometer mirror suspension technology. To prototype and de-risk future suspension technology, the vacuum system should have minimum dimensions of 2.7 metres tall with 1.2 m by 0.8 m rectangular base footprint. Other uses will include testing of Birmingham/Glasgow collaboratively produced 6D sensors. The system should be capable of reaching a lowest working pressure of 1 x 10-7 mbar, and be able to be pumped from atmospheric pressure to this in a period of 4-7 days. Internally the system must be capable of supporting up to 2 tonnes of internal load as well as its own weight. The system should include monitoring gauges and pumps. To enable the system to be installed in our lab, it should be able to be transported through a 1.5-metre-wide x 2-metre-tall door, and then installed upright in the lab space.

- Creating opportunities for decision makers to hear the voice of lived experience:  KPIs might include number of meetings and evaluation of their impact.
- Identifying and supporting people to participate in individual evaluation and consultation exercises. e.g. evaluating bids for grants etc.
KPI’s will be drawn up which will have clear expectations around the number of people engaged and reports on their satisfaction and participation.

Glow is Scotland's national digital environment that offers a number of different services to support learning and teaching across the curriculum.
Glow Blogs is a service that is available to all Glow users to allow them to create, manage and host websites. It is currently a fully managed WordPress multisite environment which resides on an AWS infrastructure. There are around 60,000 sites (blogs) in the environment and an average of 1,500,000 monthly page views. These sites may, for example, be private and used by learners recording their work or be public for schools to share resources. The service offers users a selection of themes and plugins that have educational value and these must be kept up to date and sometimes customised with factors such as safeguarding in mind.
The AWS infrastructure has a provided a high level of reliability and was designed to be flexible with features such as auto-scaling used. A high level of reliability and flexibility is required due to ever changing user requirements, including but not limited to, an increase in remote working. The WordPress application provides a selection of themes and plugins that provide functionality based on user requirements. Both the infrastructure and application continue to be improved by taking an Agile approach to development and making changes based on user stories.
It is expected that any potential Service Provider would have sufficient technical knowledge and an understanding of how such a service should be best provided and maintained. It is anticipated that the current offering of Glow Blogs through a WordPress multisite hosted in AWS will continue to be how the service is provided.
Potential Service Providers must note that the information provided as part of this process will be used as background to the procurement strategy and tender documents for the requirement only.
This process will be undertaken entirely on a without commitment basis and no undertaking is given that any potential Service Provider will be included in the tender process. Submitted questionnaires shall not be evaluated or scored and shall be excluded from evaluation at the tender stage.

Degraded peatlands can release carbon contributing to the enhanced greenhouse effect.  The Scottish Government has decided that peatlands, in degraded condition, should be restored where possible to help mitigate the impacts of future climate change. With the aim of restoring areas of degraded peatland, Peatland ACTION was established in 2012.  Funded by the Scottish Government and managed through five delivery Organisations which include the Cairngorms National Park Authority, Peatland ACTION has helped to put more than 43,000ha of impacted peatland on the road to recovery to date. Restoration work is funded under the assumption that treatment work has a net positive effect on the carbon balance of a site, whether slowing losses or promoting gains.
This SoR sets out the requirements for the delivery of a project to restore degraded peat on this land holding that will help deliver this objective and provide other associated environmental benefits.",Price is not the only award criterion and all criteria are stated only in the procurement documents,,"NUTS code:

Supply Chain Mechanism for Carbon Capture and Storage on the Seabed,APR503954,ocds-r6ebe6-0000764610,Crown Estate Scotland,26/04/2024,28/05/2024,12:00,02 Contract Notice (below GPA/OJEU threshold or call offs of any value),Yes,Yes,"This Invitation to Tender (""ITT"") initiates a call to appoint a consultancy to provide advice to Crown Estate Scotland (“CES”) on a supply chain requirement to be incorporated to seabed agreements for Carbon Capture and Storage (“CCS”). This work will be delivered by a written report, preceded by a workshop during which the findings will be presented. Three deliverables will be achieved in these estimated timescales:(1) Draft report: 8 weeks after kick-off meeting(2) Report presented to CES: 2 weeks after (1)(3) Final Report: 2 week after (2)CPV: 71310000, 71310000.","Background
CES is responsible for leasing carbon dioxide storage areas of seabed in Scottish waters within the Gas Storage and Importation Zone.
The North Sea Transition Authority (“NSTA”) are the regulator of licences for offshore carbon dioxide (“CO2”) appraisal and storage licences in UK waters (excluding projects that are wholly within Scottish Territorial Waters (which is 12nm from the shoreline in Scotland)).
NSTA administered their first carbon storage licensing round in 2023, resulting in licences being offered for six areas in Scottish waters. In alignment with the Energy Act 2008, the licence holders are required to obtain seabed agreements from CES.
https://www.nstauthority.co.uk/regulatory-information/licensing-and-consents/carbon-storage/
Those licence holders who meet CES’ criteria will be granted exclusive CCS development rights over their proposed storage site. These rights will be provided by an Exclusivity Agreement (or similar) and will allow licence holders to appraise their sites and ultimately apply to NSTA for a Storage Permit.
Once a site has been fully appraised, Storage Permit secured, and any other conditions included in the Exclusivity Agreement have been met, a Lease may be awarded for construction and operation of a CCS project. Under a Lease, rent is due to be paid to CES. CES’ revenues are paid to the Scottish Government.
CCS will be needed for Scotland to meet its climate targets and CES is committed to enabling the growth of the CCS sector in a sustainable manner, stimulating the local supply chain and supporting the Just Transition.
Objective of the Tender
CES is seeking to appoint a consultancy to evaluate the applicability of the Supply Chain Development Statement (“SCDS”)previously applied in offshore wind leasing, for the CCS sector. Additionally, a supply chain mechanism alternative to SCDS shall be proposed and evaluated by the consultant.
Specification – Scope of Work
CES’ interests are focused on the transport and storage elements of offshore CCS projects. Rent will be payable to CES for pipelines and for the seabed area under Lease, beyond 12 nautical miles from shore. To assist potential bidders in preparing their response to this ITT, an example transport and storage shall be modelled:","Criteria below:

The Trust is working in partnership with land managers, local communities, environmental NGOs, businesses and the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park Authority to deliver this long-term project.Wetland habitat restoration at the Colin Burt Reserve has been identified as one of several key nature restoration initiatives that will be delivered across the Strathfillan landscape over the next two years. The reserve is 16.5 hectares in area, with wetland habitat covering 9.5 hectares. Attempts to drain the wetland habitat for cattle and sheep grazing have been made in the past, but unsuccessfully. After the purchase in 2005, it has been unmanaged and is now dominated by Deschampsia cespitosa (Tufted hairgrass).The site is situated on the floodplain of the River Dochart, and in addition to wetland habitat, the site includes a conifer plantation, grassland habitat, and areas of recent native woodland planting. The site floods extensively every winter, completely submerging the wetland habitat, right up to the conifer plantation. With sensitive management, we aim to reduce the grass cover, and increase botanical species diversity. We would like to do this by introducing some wetland features to increase habitat heterogeneity. This includes creating scrapes and ponds, as well as maintaining and increasing the existing botanically rich ditches that currently support Beaver on the site.CPV: 71351900, 71351900, 90721100, 92533000, 92530000.","Our aspiration for the site is to increase the biodiversity of the wetland habitat. We intend to do this by:
- Adopting a grass cutting regime to reduce sward height in some areas and allow the underlying wetland species to become better established.
- Increase the botanical and structural diversity of vegetation which is currently uniform across the site.
- Create some scrapes and ponds to increase habitat heterogeneity.
- Planting of native wetland plants through seeds and possibly wildflower plugs across the wetland habitat for example along existing ditches or the new scrapes and ponds.
- Possibly undertaking some tree planting of Willow species and Alder along some of the ditches to provide more feeding opportunities for Beavers, while being mindful of potential breeding waders such as Curlew.
The services that we are currently seeking are in relation to the hydrological aspect of this project. We require advice on what we can do to improve the diversity of hydrological features on the site. The site is hydrologically complex, and we require the expertise of a hydrologist to advise us on the following:
- We want to know more about the site’s hydrology and underlying geology to inform us of whether it is possible to create ponds and scrapes that would hold water.
- If it is deemed possible to create them, we require advice on where we put them, how we design them in terms of their depth and size, and how many we create (and any other design requirements we need to consider). If test pits are required, this could form part of the contract.
- We would like to know how long scrapes and ponds would retain water during the year.
- Some advice on how to manage the large ditches, being mindful that they are used extensively by beavers. We would like to know if there is anything we can do to manage or improve the ditches that would be beneficial for the biodiversity of the site, while also maintaining the ditches as a food source for Beavers.
- Any other advice regarding how we could sensitively manage the hydrology of the site for the benefit of biodiversity and increasing habitat heterogeneity.
We are seeking submissions from applicants who can provide services as described above. Applicants will need to demonstrate a proven track record of delivering similar studies to inform wetland habitat restoration work. Involvement in delivery of wetland habitat restoration work would also be helpful but not a necessary requirement.
Scope of services:
The objective of this contract is to assess the site geology and hydrology, and based on this, make recommendations for the design of wetland habitat restoration features including, but not limited to, ponds, scrapes, and ditches. This is with the aim of benefiting and increasing biodiversity and habitat heterogeneity.
The scope of services also includes considering annual extensive flooding of the site, and how this may impact wetland features. Consulting flood maps or models is therefore within the scope of this contract.",Price is not the only award criterion and all criteria are stated only in the procurement documents,"71351900

Project for Overcladding Works at the John Anderson Building (2024-25),MAY504734,ocds-r6ebe6-0000765796,University of Strathclyde,07/05/2024,,,01 Prior Information Notice (PIN),No,No,"This Prior Information Notice (PIN) relates to the appointment of a works / construction contractor for the Project for Overcladding Works at the John Anderson Building (2024-25) (UOS-32499-2024) at the University of Strathclyde.CPV: 45000000, 45000000, 45262650, 44212381, 45214400.","This project has been funded through the Scottish Funding Council's (SFC) University Financial Transactions Programme (UFTP). The project is part of the University’s net zero pathway programme in alignment with our Strategic Plan (Strathclyde 2030) to reduce carbon emissions as part of our Key Performance Indicator (KPI) 16 that sets bold targets of 80% carbon reduction by 2030, and to be net zero by 2040. Building fabric and services improvements have been identified as high priority projects that are key to the successful delivery of our net zero pathway to achieving these challenging but mandated targets. This project provides the opportunity to significantly improve the energy performance of John Anderson Building by reducing its current heat loss from 589.0kW to 323.8kW. This equates to a 54.97% reduction due to improvements in the building fabric and air permeability.
This project involves the design, manufacture, supply and installation of overcladding of the John Anderson Building, located off Rottenrow East in the city centre of Glasgow. Built in 1971, the John Anderson Building has had ongoing problems with water ingress over a number of years due to the failing façade. The decision has been made to resolve the current issues by overcladding the reinforced concrete framed building using fully demountable ‘cassette’ type aluminium rainscreen cladding system, incorporating insulation, fixed back to the main structure and holding the current panels in place including anchors, brackets rails, trimmers, insulation, firebreaks, panels and flashings. The system will be designed to ensure that it meets all current building regulations. The cladding will have a life expectancy of 60 years plus and be fully recyclable at the end of its useful life. As part of the works, the existing windows will be replaced by installing high performance windows to all facades of the building. The specification will meet current regulations for thermal and sound control, increase natural daylight and reduce the heat loss of the building.
The University is seeking to find, by competitive tender, a specialist overcladdding contractor to undertake the above works on a design & build basis, providing a single point of responsibility from detailed design through to delivery of a completed total envelope solution. Initial works will include the survey, testing and analysis of the existing structure and panels, and stabilisation and remediation of the existing panels to ensure their future security. A full structural and architectural design will be required for both this and the cladding solution. Throughout the project, structural reports and detailed design information will be supplied to the Employer’s Agent for confirmation of conformance to the design intent, and such information must be provided promptly to allow time for review. A 25 year insurance backed warranty of the completed works is a requirement. An on-site programme of c. 38 weeks is anticipated, this is inclusive of 4 weeks lead in time for bespoke materials and completion of a survey and structural design calculations, subject to the successful contractor’s confirmation.

The burn was altered and straightened over 150 years ago to facilitate the floating of logs to a local mill. The surrounding land use is still forestry, but the landowner, Forestry and Land Scotland want to restore the watercourse to a more natural state and improve the surrounding wetland habitats. This work is being undertaken as part of the Cairngorms Connect project, funded by the Endangered Landscapes Programme.
The site is designated as part of the River Spey Special Protection Area (SPA) for salmon and is also part of the Cairngorms Special Area of Conservation (SAC). The restoration work is designed to improve the condition of habitats locally that will benefit both of the designated areas and the work must be carried out sensitively to avoid damage or pollution.
The ecological consultants EnviroCentre have produced a study and options appraisal for restoration of a 1km straightened section of the burn, which can be sub-divided into two reaches, the upper reach and lower reach. The approved design involves the excavation of a relict channel which has been identified by drone survey beside the lower reach, the harvesting and transportation of recently windblown trees close to the site to form the large wood structures and the installation of a range of large wood structures throughout the upper and lower reaches. The large wood structures serve a range of purposes and the details of locations and engineering design are provided in the attached ‘673614_Allt a' Mharcaidh_Design Brief 230118’ and the ‘673614_Allt a' Mharcaidh_Design Risk Assessment 230118’.
The design consists of 21 lateral structures dug into the banks and 1 medial structure dug into the bed of the burn in the upper reach and 3 log jams and 6 medial blockages in the lower reach to discourage flow returning to the canalised channel and 1 upstream tie in to divert the burn into the excavated relict channel.",Price is not the only award criterion and all criteria are stated only in the procurement documents,"71310000

It will involve:- evaluating the delivery of these programmes against their intended aims;- engaging with a range of stakeholders to examine the strategic fit of these programmes within a wider policy and funding context, and in relation to other public and third sector policy and interventions;- producing options and practical recommendations on future areas of focus and delivery models.This review will draw on a range of previous research, including a desk review due for completion by June 2024 (see Section 3).This specification sets out the aims and objectives of this work, provides background information on the policy approach and provides a suggested methodological approach to realising these aims. It sets out the tasks required of the contractor, management arrangements and timescales. Where appropriate, contractors are invited to suggest alternative approaches to meeting the aims and objectives of this review within the available budget and timescale.The research will support the work of Scottish Government policy officials and Ministers in developing a new Rural Support Plan as well as wider rural policy.

While there are disparate strands of data available on these issues, these data are not comprehensive enough to be used for accurate monitoring and evaluation of Scottish Government energy and climate change policies, or to meaningfully inform related policy decisions.
The aim of the survey is to generate reliable estimates of Scottish adults’ awareness and understanding of, and engagement with, climate change-related issues. It will also cover views and experiences of the costs and benefits of climate change policies. This will help the Scottish Government track the impact of current work, and tailor future programmes of work on climate change across a wide range of important policy areas. These areas include, but not limited to, engagement and behaviours on issues including heating and energy efficiency, transport, land use, climate change adaptation, just transition and biodiversity.
The project will design and carry out the first survey. The project has two aims:
1.develop a replicable survey that:
a.provides robust information on energy and climate change-related public understanding, attitudes and behaviours among adults (16+) in Scotland;
b.enables disaggregation of such information both geographically and demographically; and
c.enables detection of trends over time, and a discussion of how often the survey should be repeated, including consideration of wider Scottish Government survey activity as set out above.

These designations recognise the internationally important blanket bog habitat present across Airds Moss. Significant areas of Airds Moss have been drained in the past for agriculture, and have also suffered from overstocking with livestock and excessive burning.
Scotland’s peatlands represent one of the most significant carbon stores, but large areas are degraded often as result of historic patterns of land management. Degraded peatlands release carbon thus contributing to the enhanced greenhouse effect. In light of this, the RSPB has been undertaking peatland restoration at Airds Moss since 2010 and we are now looking to continue this work over the coming years.
The restoration work included in this invitatation to tender is Phase 2 of a three phase peatland restoration project at a relatively new section of RSPB Airds Moss, Airds Moss Central. The present work will be covering 43.1ha, with subsequent works covering 83.1ha planned for October 2025-March 2026.
Drains, peat hags and eroding gullies across this area will be restored, in addition to micro-erosion features between linear drains.This work will further enhance the conditions that will reinstate healthy blanket bog and support important plant and animal species. Detailed maps and restoration treatments are included with this tender. The site has been assessed and requires a combination of work using a range of machinery of appropriate size on extra wide low ground pressure tracks for peat-based techniques and manual construction by hand of timber dams.
We have chosen a variety of restoration techniques that are suitable for this site which are set out in the below specification. The supplier will be expected to use their expertise in peatland restoration to adjust restoration techniques if the ground conditions require this. RSPB site staff will be present on site regularly and there will be opportunity to discuss any proposed adjustments.",Price is not the only award criterion and all criteria are stated only in the procurement documents,,"NUTS code:
